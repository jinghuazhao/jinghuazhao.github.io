## Citation (quoting ChatGPT)

The **Henry Stewart Talks** series shows:

> **Zhao, J.H. (2026, January 28). *Genetic association analysis with R: latest developments.***
> Published in *The Biomedical & Life Sciences Collection*, Henry Stewart Talks. DOI: **10.69645/FRFQ9519**. ([HSTalks][1])

That DOI is the **formal reference** for this HSTalks lecture and is what you should cite if you want the *latest development* talk by Dr. Jing Hua Zhao (University of Cambridge) on genetic association analysis using R. ([HSTalks][1])
