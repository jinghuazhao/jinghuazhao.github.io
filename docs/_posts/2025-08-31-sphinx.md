I am pleased to share extensions of two canonical (1 & 2 below) and a customised (3 below) themes,

## 1. sphinx-rtd-theme

A new repository, sphinx <https://github.com/jinghuazhao/sphinx>, highlights the long-awaited adoption of the theme incorporating the master logo and link.

## 2. jekyll-rtd-theme

Inspired by the extension above, the cambridge-ceu/csd3 site <https://cambridge-ceu.github.io/csd3/> now collapses on the side bar while showing summary information on each category and giving remarkable visual simplification.

## 3. srcf

The SRCF-style site is showcased here, <https://jinghuazhao.github.io/srcf/>.
