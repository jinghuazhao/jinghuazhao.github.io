Hi there,

Hope this email finds you well!

I noticed your site has a lot of great resources for substance abuse,
drug and alcohol.

I have an informative link (https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/resources/
<https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/resources/>)  for your website https://jinghuazhao.github.io/ <https://jinghuazhao.github.io/>

Could you please review and update it on your resource page?

This will help your site visitors and help to engage the traffic :) 

If you need any more information from me, please just let me know.

Best Regards,
Rachel

Hey there,

Hope you're having a good time.

I was looking through your site and saw some information about addiction at jinghuazhao.github.io. I was wondering if you might have room for additional addiction, alcohol, and cancer materials. In honour of National Substance Abuse Prevention Month in October, please see https://magnoliacitydetox.com/programs/.

The above resource from Magnolia City Detox could make a great addition to the "Resource/Helpful links" column.
 
My name is Emma Tressler, a Community Relations Specialist at Magnolia City Detox. Including the link above, I was hoping to share a few more pages and discuss the possibility of highlighting their information.
 
It was a pleasure visiting your website, and I appreciate your time in advance. Should I not hear back, do you mind me reaching out next week? If not, please let me know, and I'll refrain from sending any further emails.
 
Have a nice day.

Regards,
