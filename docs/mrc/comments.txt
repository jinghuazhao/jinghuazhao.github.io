Hello Mr. Jing,  

I know you probably get a TON of emails from your readers, so I’ll try to keep this one really short.
My name is Karen Hadley, a financial instructor and I'm getting in touch with you about your resource page: https://jhz22.user.srcf.net/mrclinks.htm and it was very handy and I find it really very helpful
I also wanted to ask if you're still updating that resource page. I would also like to suggest some additional free resources.
You can review our resources below:

Wallstreetmojo: This website provides free courses on topics such as Finance, Accounting, Excel, VBA, Financial Modelling, and Ratio Analysis.

    Wallstreetmojo also provides free tutorials. You may find it here: https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/blog/

I hope this will be a great addition to your resources list.

Either way, keep up the great work!

Thanks for taking the time to read this email. Above all, hope you're keeping safe? 
And If sent to the wrong contact, kindly redirect to the correct contact.

Thanks
Karen

Hello Jing Hua,

I hope you have been well and safe this past week! I just wanted to get back in touch with you and see if you had any thoughts about what I outlined in my last email and if perhaps you had the chance to consider posting our link to your page https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html?

Here it is again in case you missed it -- Mesothelioma Cancer.

We would be so grateful for the opportunity to provide a space for support and to educate your visitors about this disease! I hope to hear back again and wish you a lovely day. 

Jessica

Good morning,

I hope you're having a nice week and this email finds you in good health. My name is Jessica Fisher and I'm reaching out to you today because I noticed you provide some useful health resources on https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html and I was hoping you would be interested in an additional resource for jinghuazhao.github.io? 

I'd like to discuss this more in depth at your convenience. You can always reach me at this same email. And if for some reason we don't connect today, would it be okay to try again next week?

I appreciate your time in advance, and look forward to hearing from you.

Jessica

Hello,

Forgive the extra email, I just wanted to see if you got my question below - any response would be greatly appreciated.  If you're not the right 
contact, it would be fantastic if you could point me in the right direction or pass my message along.

Thanks so much,

Sarah

Hello,

I found that you are providing some health information on your page https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.htm - including sites like the National 
Cancer Institute - and I wanted to suggest an addition.

My current project is creating more awareness and better prevention of a serious health issue that is underserved in healthcare and education.

There is truth in the common notion that dark skinned individuals are more resistant to skin cancer (1 in 10 cases are black people), there is danger in 
ignoring the issue completely.

With a 34% death rate, black people are 3 times more likely than white people to die from melanoma within 5 years of diagnosis. These severe cases are 
due mostly to a lack in early detection.

This is due in part to an absence in education of the danger and signs in both schools and among healthcare professionals. Most doctors are taught the 
signs on white skin, which are different in appearance and location.

Because of that, I was wondering if you could add this to your site, which I've found to be the best consolidated resource on the matter – 
well-researched and accessible: https://thedermreview.com/skin-cancer-awareness-prevention-for-people-of-color/

It would mean a lot to me if you could let me know if you can add it, or what you think. If you prefer that I do not contact you, just let me know.

Thanks so much for your time and attention - I look forward to hearing back.

Warm regards,
