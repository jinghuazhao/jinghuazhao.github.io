Hello Jing,  

I hope all is well. We've all heard the common phrase: "Drink in
moderation." it turns out that this phrase may be more important than we
thought. Recent studies have shown that no level of alcohol consumption
is safe for our health and can cause cancer. Alcohol is a level-one
carcinogen, right up with tobacco and asbestos, which means it is a
substance that causes cancer.

That's why we recently updated our guide to the potential effects of
alcohol, focusing on the link between alcohol and cancer. Here is our
guide:https://alcoholrehabhelp.org/addiction/effects/cancer/
<https://alcoholrehabhelp.org/addiction/effects/cancer/>.

We include the following:

  *
    An overview of the link between alcohol and cancer.
  *
    The types of cancer that can be caused by alcohol consumption. 
  *
    How drinking alcohol affects the body. 


I believe your readers would benefit from our article. Would you help us
help your readers by adding a link to our guide on your site? 

You can add it here:https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html
<https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html>.

I think your readers would benefit from our resource, and I would be
happy to answer any questions you have about it.
