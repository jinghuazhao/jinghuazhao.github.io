title: Understanding the AppWizard and ClassWizard in Visual C++ Version 6.x by Marshall Brain
---

## Series Overview

It is possible to use the Visual C++ development environment as a big C
compiler. Using it that way you can certainly create GUI applications
using the Win32 API. However, you will be wasting a lot of the potential
of the environment. Visual C++ contains a variety of visual tools that,
once you know how to use them, can tremendously accelerate your software
development cycle. These tools, which include the AppWizard, ClassWizard
and the resource editors, make full use of the C++ language and the MFC
(Microsoft Foundation Classes) class hierarchy.

The problem with these tools is that they are fairly complicated, and
there is not much introductory material available on how to use them.
The purpose of these tutorials is to show you, using extremely clear and
easy-to-understand examples, exactly what the AppWizard and ClassWizard
are, what they can do, and exactly how to use them. Along the way you
will find out why the AppWizard generates 20 files and what all of those
files do, what the \"document/view paradigm\" is and how it makes
application development easier, and how to fit the code you develop into
an AppWizard framework with a minimum amount of effort on your part.
Once you have finished these tutorials you will have a very clear
understanding of why these tools exist and how you can use them to
create your own applications.

Note: If you do not know C++ these tutorials will be opaque to you.
Please run through the C++ tutorials first. If you do not have any
knowledge of MFC these tutorials will be fairly muddy. Please look at
the introductory MFC tutorials first.
