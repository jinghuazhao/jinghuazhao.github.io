## Security

One of the most fascinating parts of Windows NT is its security system.
It is possible to almost completely ignore this part of the Win32 API if
you don\'t care to secure things. However, there are many situations
where the security features built into NT can help to solve some very
interesting problems. In this article you will learn about the intent of
the NT\'s security system, the concepts that help you to understand what
is going on, and the techniques used to manipulate it.

Please note that some of the code in this chapter will not work as
described unless you log in as the administrator. Only administrators
have the rights necessary to perform some of the system security tasks
demonstrated here.

### THE POSSIBILITIES

Most people have never seen or worked with a security system as complete
and intricate as NT\'s. Experienced UNIX programmers are familiar with
UNIX\'s file security system and with the idea of root privileges, but
these systems are primitive compared to NT\'s. The following examples
give you some feeling for the scope and preciseness of NT\'s security
system.

People using the NT File System can see the security features built into
it because of the Security menu and security editor in the File Manager.
You can write your own code that modifies the security information in an
NT File System volume at that same level of detail. From programs that
you write, you can control who has what type of access to any file on an
NTFS volume, just like the File Manager does.

-   You can create a named pipe server on one system that, for example,
    only administrators on other systems can access. When people try to
    connect to the server, the security system will check to make sure
    they have the proper access authority and reject users who do not
    have administrative privileges. You might do this so that
    administrators on different machines can send information to one
    another in a way that guarantees authenticity. You can write code so
    that it selectively allows or denies access to any user or group of
    users, or to all users.
-   You can create a mutex with security attributes that allow only
    certain users or groups to access it. This capability applies to any
    object in the system: files, semaphores, threads, events, shared
    memory in file mappings, etc. In the case of a mutex, you can use
    this facility to guard against unauthorized access to the
    synchronization mechanism of an application.
-   You can give any object (for example, a thread, mutex, pipe, file or
    registry key) the ability to create an entry in the event log
    whenever it is accessed. You can specify individual types of access,
    and individual users, that generate an event log entry. For example,
    you can cause a specific file to generate an event log entry
    whenever the user smith successfully reads that file.

The above examples show that NT allows you to give precise security
access to specific objects in the system, and it also allows you to
monitor and record how objects are used.

### UNDERSTANDING THE TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS OF THE NT SECURITY SYSTEM

One of the most interesting and frustrating parts of the NT security
system is the huge number of new concepts that it contains, along with
the vocabulary that describes these concepts. The goal of this section
is to put those concepts into simple terms so that you can understand
them.

By now you are already familiar with the most visible part of the
security system: passwords. You can think of the password system as the
lock on the front door of a building. The password system keeps people
out of an NT system just like a lock on a building keeps people from
wandering around in the lobby. Your password gives you a key to the
building that is an NT system.

If one of your hard disks is formatted with the NT File System, then you
know that there is a second layer of security in NT as well. You can
think of this second layer as locks on individual rooms inside of the
building. Some rooms are wide open and anyone can walk in, while others
have locks on them. The locks on an individual room can be very specific
in NT. For example, you can create a file on a volume formatted with the
NT File System and you can let any combination of people access it:

-   You can let no one but the owner access it
-   You can let only a single user access it
-   You can let several individual users access it
-   You can name an NT group and let any member of that group access it
-   You can name an NT group and let any member of that group access it,
    but then specifically deny access to individual members of the group
-   You can name multiple groups that can access it
-   You can let anyone access it

Think of a secured file as a room. The security permissions that you put
on the file are like a lock that determines who is allowed into the
room. You can also control what a person is allowed to do once they get
into a room. For example, with a file you can give one user read access,
another user write access, and so on. See the Permissions dialog in the
Security menu of the File Manager for examples.

Think of NT as a building full of rooms. Your password gives you a key
that lets you into the building. Once inside, you can then use your key
to enter individual rooms. Some rooms have no locks, while other are
locked and will let you in, and still others will refuse you entry. The
rooms are individual objects in the NT system: files, registry keys,
thread and mutex objects, etc.

You can also put a sentry at the door of any of the rooms. The sentry\'s
job is to monitor who uses the room, and how they use it. This is called
auditing in NT. When you attach an auditing request to an NT object, the
object writes entries in the security portion of the event log whenever
certain users access the object in specified ways. For example, if you
have access to an NT file system volume and have administrative
privileges, open the File Manager and select a file that you own. Then
select the Auditing option in the Security menu. For any individual user
or group, you can detect when they successfully or unsuccessfully (or
both) read the file, write to the file, execute the file, and so on.

The most obvious place to see these security features is in the NT File
System. The security editor in the File Manager lets you easily and
graphically manipulate all of the different security features available
for files. This same level of security detail applies to many different
objects in NT. For example, you can secure items in the Registry with
this level of detail, and in fact the registry editor contains the same
sort of visual security editor that the File Manager contains. You can
also specify security attributes on many internal system objects. For
example, you can limit access to a named pipe (see Section 10.9) in this
way.

Here is a brief summary of the concepts discussed above:

-   An NT system is like a building. Your password gives you a key into
    the building.
-   Once you are inside you find potentially thousands of rooms. A file
    is like a room, and so is a registry entry, a named pipe, a thread,
    and so on.
-   Each room can be secured by its owner with a lock that is keyed for
    user and group IDs. That is, the owner of the room can let just one
    person use the room, or a collection of users and groups, or
    everyone.
-   Each room can also be manned with a sentry who detects and records
    who enters the room and what each person does once they are inside.

Now that you understand the general concepts, let\'s look at some of
NT\'s specific vocabulary for discussing security.

### NT SECURITY VOCABULARY

When you log into an NT system, the system gives you an access token.
The access token is your key to all of the locks found in an NT system.
Your key will turn some locks, but it will not work in all of them. Each
process that you create contains a copy of your access token.

The access token does two different things. First, it identifies who you
are. For example, if you logged in as the user \"smith\", then your
access token contains your identity as that user. The access token also
identifies you by all of the groups you belong to. For example, in the
User Manager you may be a member of the Power User group, the Backup
Operator group, and a custom group named Programmers. Your access token
identifies you as a member of these different groups.

Your access token also contains all of your user rights. Each group you
belong can have user rights, or privileges, associated with it. If you
open the User Manager you can look at the list of rights with the User
Rights menu option. For example, power users have the right to set the
system time, while normal users do not. Some users can shut down the
system while others cannot, and so on. The system builds up the list of
rights in your access token by combining all of the individual rights
found in each group you belong to. Individual users can also have
special rights granted to them specifically by the administrator with
the User Manager.

![](token.gif){width="384" height="216"}

An access token contains a user ID, the names of the groups the user
belongs to, and the combined user rights from all of those groups

Most of the objects in the system can have locks on them. In NT, a lock
is called a security descriptor. If the Create function for an object
contains a security parameter, you can lock it. The following objects
can have locks:

-   Files (if they exist on an NT File System volume)
-   Directories (if they exist on an NT File System volume)
-   Registry keys
-   Processes
-   Threads
-   Mutexes
-   Semaphores
-   Events
-   Named Pipes (on the system and over the network)
-   Anonymous Pipes (on the system only)
-   Mailslots (on the system only)
-   Console screen buffers
-   File mappings
-   Services
-   Private objects

To lock an object, you create a security descriptor and pass it to the
object when you create it. In all of the previous sections in this book,
the example code has passed a zero in for the security attributes
parameter. The zero indicates to the system that it should create a
default security descriptor that allows you to access the object. See
the book for a description of default security descriptors.

A security descriptor contains four things:

-   An owner identifier that identifies the current owner of the object
-   A primary group identifier
-   A system access control list, or SACL, that contains auditing
    information
-   A discretionary access control list, or DACL, that determines which
    users and groups can and cannot access the object.

The owner of an NT object can always set its security information. For
example, if you own a file and accidentally set it so that no one can
access it, you can still go back and change its security because you are
the owner. It is like breaking the lock to your house: Even though the
lock is broken, you can always replace it with a new one because you own
the house.

![](sd.gif){width="264" height="240"}

The security descriptor for any object contains the owner and group IDs,
the discretionary access control list that determines who can and cannot
access the object, and the system access control list that controls who
gets audited when they use the object

The DACL (Discretionary Access Control List) is the heart of the actual
lock. It controls who can and cannot access the object. It is an access
control list, or ACL, that contains access control entries, or ACEs.
Each ACE indicates one user or group, along with what they can or cannot
do to the object. For example, if the object is a file and the user
\"smith\" is allowed to read from the file, then there will be an ACE
that indicates that user \"smith\" has read access. This is called an
access allowed ACE because it allows a user or group to do something.
There is one access allowed ace for each person or group allowed to
access the object. Similarly, there are access denied ACEs which deny
specific users or groups access. For example, if you have given the
group Power Users access to an object, but \"smith\" is a power user and
you don\'t want him to have access, an access denied ACE keeps him out.

The SACL (System Access Control List) also contains ACEs, but these ACEs
determine who will be audited and why. An ACE in a SACL is called an
audit access ACE. For example, if the system is supposed to create an
audit entry whenever the user \"smith\" successfully reads a file, one
ACE in the SACL states that.

![](ace.gif){width="384" height="144"}

An Access Control Entry (ACE) specifies one user or group (the SID
identifies the user or group) and the type of access allowed. ACEs are
stored in ACLs (see Figure 10.3).

To convey its information, each ACE in an ACL consists of three parts: a
Security Identifier, or SID, an access mask, and an ACE header. The SID
is a value stored in the registry (and also available through function
calls) that uniquely identifies each user or group that exists in the
User Manager. The ACE header determines the type of ACE: access allowed,
access denied, etc. An access mask is a 32-bit mask that determines what
the user can do with the object. There are standard rights that apply to
all objects on the system. Some objects also have a variety of special
access rights that apply only to them. For example, you can apply the
following specific and standard access rights to a file object:

###### specific:

-   FILE\_READ\_DATA
-   FILE\_WRITE\_DATA
-   FILE\_APPEND\_DATA
-   FILE\_READ\_EA
-   FILE\_WRITE\_EA
-   FILE\_EXECUTE
-   FILE\_READ\_ATTRIBUTES
-   FILE\_WRITE\_ATTRIBUTES
-   FILE\_ALL\_ACCESS

###### standard:

-   DELETE
-   READ\_CONTROL
-   STANDARD\_RIGHTS\_ALL
-   STANDARD\_RIGHTS\_EXECUTE
-   STANDARD\_RIGHTS\_READ
-   STANDARD\_RIGHTS\_REQUIRED
-   STANDARD\_RIGHTS\_WRITE
-   SYNCHRONIZE
-   WRITE\_DAC
-   WRITE\_OWNER

###### generic:

-   GENERIC\_ALL
-   GENERIC\_EXECUTE
-   GENERIC\_READ
-   GENERIC\_WRITE

The generic rights are pre-defined combinations of standard and specific
rights and change from object to object. See Section 10.5 for more
information on these securable objects and their access rights.

An access mask is simply a 32-bit bit-mask. Each of the standard,
specific and generic rights have a bit associated with them in the
access mask. The first 16 bits hold specific rights and are keyed to the
object that the access mask refers to (for example, the FILE\_ constants
above). The next 8 bits hold standard rights. The high-order four bits
hold generic rights.

The bit layout of an access mask

As you can see, there is a whole cornucopia of new terminology used to
describe NT\'s security features. However, you will become intimately
familiar with all of these words as you work through the sample code,
and all of the concepts are easy to understand. Here is a quick summary:

-   When users log in, they receive access tokens. An access token
    contains the user\'s ID, the user\'s groups, and the user\'s
    privileges culled from the groups.
-   Each object has a security descriptor that acts as its lock. A
    security descriptor contains an owner and group identifier, a System
    ACL, and a Discretionary ACL.
-   A DACL controls who is allowed to do what to the object
-   A SACL controls who is audited for doing what to an object
-   ACLs consist of ACEs. Each ACE contains a SID that identifies the
    user or group, an access mask that determines the actions allowed to
    the user or group, and an ACE header that determines the type of
    ACE.

The following section presents two simple example to show how the
security functions and all of this vocabulary fit together.

### SIMPLE EXAMPLES

The purpose of this section is to walk through the creation and
application of a security descriptor for a file object. A file object is
chosen for this example because it is common and easily understood, and
also because it is easy to view the results with the security editor in
the File Manager to prove that the code works. However, if your hard
disk is not formatted with the NT File System, this code will not do
anything and the security editor is disabled. You have three options if
this is the case:

1.  Reformat your hard disk with NTFS and reload NT, or use the
    **convert** command to convert your hard disk to the NT file system.
2.  Install a new hard disk and format it with the NT File System
3.  Partition off a small section (say 10 megabytes) of your existing
    hard disk and format it with NTFS. This means that you will have to
    reformat and reload the original partition as well

Alternatively, you can wait a moment and we will apply this same code to
a registry key. You will be able to see the security editor in the
registry editor regardless of the file system that you are using.

The code below contains a program that creates a new file. The security
descriptor for the new file is set up so that only the user \"guest\"
can use the file, and the user can do nothing but read it. The program
contains absolutely no error checking so that the essentials are easy to
see. When you run the code, it should create a file on **c:\\** named
**testfile**. Select the file in the File Manager and then choose the
Permissions option in the Security menu. You will find that there is one
entry in the list: The user \"guest\" can read the file. Feel free to
change the name of the file or the name of the user when you run the
code yourself.

```c
    #include <windows.h> 
    #include <iostream.h> 
     
    SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES sa;
    SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR sd;
    BYTE aclBuffer[1024];
    PACL pacl=(PACL)&aclBuffer;
    BYTE sidBuffer[100];
    PSID psid=(PSID) &sidBuffer;
    DWORD sidBufferSize = 100;
    char domainBuffer[80];
    DWORD domainBufferSize = 80;
    SID_NAME_USE snu;
    HANDLE file;
     
    void main(void)
    {
      InitializeSecurityDescriptor(&sd,
        SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR_REVISION);
      InitializeAcl(pacl, 1024, ACL_REVISION);
      LookupAccountName(0, "guest", psid,
        &sidBufferSize, domainBuffer,
        &domainBufferSize, &snu);
      AddAccessAllowedAce(pacl, ACL_REVISION,
        GENERIC_READ, psid);
      SetSecurityDescriptorDacl(&sd, TRUE, pacl,
        FALSE);
     
      sa.nLength= sizeof(SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES);
      sa.bInheritHandle = FALSE;
      sa.lpSecurityDescriptor = &sd;
     
      file = CreateFile("c:\\testfile", 
        GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, 
        0, &sa, CREATE_NEW, 
        FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, 0);
      CloseHandle(file);
    }
```
Start by looking at the bottom of the program. Here you will find a call
to CreateFile that creates a file named c:\\testfile. However, this call
has a security parameter at location four in the parameter list. In all
NT code you have probably seen, you have seen a zero used in this
location. The zero tells the operating system to use a default security
descriptor when it creates the object (see Section 10.8 of the book).
The zero value also disables inheritance (see Chapter 5). This code code
instead creates a SECURITY\_ATTRIBUTES structure that contains a valid
security descriptor.

The creation of a security descriptor starts with a call to the
InitializeSecurityDescriptor function seen at the first line of the
listing. *\[See the Win32 help file in the SDK or Visual C++ help files
for more information on this and the following functions.\]* This step
creates a security descriptor in absolute format (there is also a second
format called the self-relative format, and the differences are
described in Section 10.6 of the book). The new security descriptor
initially contains no information besides the revision level: no owner
identifier, no group identifier, no SACL, and no DACL.

The next line calls InitializeAcl to create the ACL that will become the
DACL for the security descriptor. When the InitializeAcl function
returns, pacl points to an empty ACL. That is, the ACL contains no ACEs.
If you were to comment out the next two lines so that this empty ACL was
placed into the security descriptor, and that security descriptor was
applied to the file, then no one would be able to access the file. In
the absence of any ACEs in the discretionary ACL, no one has access.
Alternatively, if you were to create no DACL at all and pass NULL in
during the DACL installation step below, then everyone could access the
file.

The next two lines create an ACE and add it to the ACL. The
LookupAccountName function returns a SID for the specified account name.
The LookupAccountName function looks up the account name specified on
the system specified or on the local system. If it is not found locally
the function looks on the domain controller or trusted domain
controllers if appropriate. The function returns a SID for the account,
the domain where it was found if the SID came from a domain controller,
and an enumerated value that indicates the type of account:

-   SidTypeUser
-   SidTypeGroup
-   SidTypeDomain
-   SidTypeAlias
-   SidTypeWellKnownGroup
-   SidTypeDeletedAccount
-   SidTypeInvalid
-   SidTypeUnknown

A SID is a security identifier. It uniquely identifies a user or a group
to the system.

The SID returned by the LookupAccountName function is used in a call to
the AddAccessAllowedAce function to create an access allowed (as opposed
to access denied) ACE and add it to the currently-empty ACL.

The AddAccessAllowedAce function creates the ACE with the SID and access
mask specified and adds it to the ACL specified. The GENERIC\_READ
access mask grants read access to the file and its attributes. See
Section 10.5 for a list of the specific and standard rights that
GENERIC\_READ adds to the access mask.

Now the code in the listing has an ACL containing one ACE that specifies
that the user \"guest\" should have read access. This ACL needs to be
placed into the Discretionary ACL of the security descriptor using the
SetSecurityDescriptorDacl function.

Now the security descriptor contains a valid DACL with one ACE in it.
The code places this security descriptor in a security attributes
structure and then passes it to the CreateFile function (see Chapter 2).

If you were to comment out the previous three lines in the code, and
replace pacl with NULL for the DACL in the call to
SetSecurityDescriptorDacl, everyone would have access to the file. The
absence of a DACL implies that everyone should be able to access the
file.

Compile and run the code. Make sure that the file name specified in the
program does not already exist when you run it. When you look at the new
file with the File Manager\'s security editor, you will find that its
permissions are set as specified in the code.

You can easily modify the code to experiment with security descriptors.
For example, try giving write access to a certain group, or add several
ACEs to the DACL, or create an access denied ACE using
AddAccessDeniedAce. Be sure that access denied ACEs precede access
allowed ACEs. Use the SetSecurityDescriptorOwner function to modify the
owner in the security descriptor.

### Another Example

This exact same security descriptor code can be applied to any other
securable NT object, because the security system is uniform across all
objects. For example, you can use it to create a key in the registry, as
demonstrated in the code below. See Chapter 15 for information on the
registry and registry keys. If you compare this listing with the
previous, you will find that they are exactly the same except that this
listing uses RegCreateKeyEx to create a registry key instead of a file.

```c
    #include <windows.h> 
    #include <iostream.h> 
     
    SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES sa;
    SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR sd;
    BYTE aclBuffer[1024];
    PACL pacl=(PACL)&aclBuffer;
    BYTE sidBuffer[100];
    PSID psid=(PSID) &sidBuffer;
    DWORD sidBufferSize = 100;
    char domainBuffer[80];
    DWORD domainBufferSize = 80;
    SID_NAME_USE snu;
    LONG result;
    HKEY regKey;
    DWORD disposition;
     
    void main(void)
    {
      InitializeSecurityDescriptor(&sd,
        SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR_REVISION);
      InitializeAcl(pacl, 1024, ACL_REVISION);
      LookupAccountName(0, "guest", psid,
        &sidBufferSize, domainBuffer,
        &domainBufferSize, &snu);
      AddAccessAllowedAce(pacl, ACL_REVISION,
        GENERIC_READ, psid);
      SetSecurityDescriptorDacl(&sd, TRUE, pacl,
        FALSE);
     
      sa.nLength= sizeof(SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES);
      sa.bInheritHandle = FALSE;
      sa.lpSecurityDescriptor = &sd;
     
      result = RegCreateKeyEx(HKEY_CURRENT_USER,
        "junk", 0, 0, REG_OPTION_VOLATILE,
        KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &sa, &regKey, 
        &disposition);
      cout <<  result <<  endl;
      RegCloseKey(regKey);
    }
```
Before running this code, run the registry editor (regedt32.exe) and
look at the HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER window to make sure HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER
does not already contain a key named \"junk\". If it does, delete it, or
modify the code to create a different key. Now run the code. Refresh the
registry editor display if it is not set to automatically refresh, and
you will see a new key named \"junk\". When you check its permissions
using the Permissions option in the Security menu, you will find that
you or \"administrator\" owns the key and that \"guest\" is the only
user who has access to it. Change the name of the key or the user as you
desire. Since the code in creates a volatile key (see Chapter 15), the
key will disappear when you log off or reboot the system.
